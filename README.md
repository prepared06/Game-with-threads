# Game-with-threads
One from five laboratory works from dicipline OC. 
In this application there are 3 checkboxes: the color,
the form of the shape's location, which is displayed on
the screen. When the checkbox is checked in the required 
checkbox, a continuous change of the figure begins until 
the tick is ticked off.
